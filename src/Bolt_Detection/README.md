# Introduction

This repo consists of the scripts created to perform Bolt Detection using Deep Learning.

## Installation

To run the scripts a python environment should be created and the packages included in the *env.yml* file need to be installed.

## Notebooks and python scripts

The python files *.py* contain helper functions (modules) that are then imported in the notebooks (*.ipynb*). Notebooks 1-4 are about creating the dataset class and dataloaders, while notebooks 5-8 are about training and evaluating the model and eventually counting the predicted bolts in the test images.
